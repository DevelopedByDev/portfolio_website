excerpt: 'embrace the continuous'

often, what separates the successful and unsuccessful is not what the successful do that the unsuccessful don't, but rather what the unsuccessful **do** that the successful **don't**. 

also, doing and not doing is usually not a discrete or binary decision. it is usually continuous. it's not like the successful don't ever get frustrated in the face of setbacks, it's just that they don't get frustrated in the face of setbacks **as much**. so, the question isn't if the successful ever get frustrated. it is more like how often do the successful get frustrated. the answer, usually, is not much (relative to the unsuccessful, who get frustrated a lot).

so:\\
the successful **don't** give into distractions **as much**.\\
the successful **don't** get bogged down by failure **as much**.\\
the successful **don't** take off days **as much**.
