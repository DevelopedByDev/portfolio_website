# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using Markdown. Markdown is a simple yet powerful format that lets me write content in a clean and readable way.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to create a space where I could share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings about:
- Biomedical Engineering
- Computer Science
- Web Development
- Deep Learning
- And much more!

## What's Next?

I plan to write about my journey in tech, share interesting projects, and discuss the intersection of technology and healthcare. Stay tuned for more content!
